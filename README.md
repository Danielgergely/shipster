To run the application go to app/src/main/java/ch/shipster/ShipsterApplication and run the main class.

When the application is started, a test user is automatically created.

To see this user go to localhost/8080/api/users (here you see all created users) or localhost/8080/api/security/users/1 (to find user by id 1)
