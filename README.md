### Shipping made easy and fun

To run the application go to ***app/src/main/java/ch/shipster/ShipsterApplication*** and run the main class.

To access the running application go to [localhost port 8080](http//:localhost:8080) and you will be redirected to the home page.

After starting the application one needs to authenticate. To do that you can go to the register (sign up) page, register and
then use your credentials to log in.
